# Cyberdeck — Build Plan

*Companion to `cyberdeck-spec.md`. Tracks what's shipped, what's next,
and what's deferred (with reasoning, so we don't have to re-derive
priority next session).*

---

## Shipped

### Tier 1 — original scope
M0 Construct, M1 Fleet, M2 TUI skeleton, M3 keyboard model, M4a
Daemon-driven goals, M5.1–M5.3e (keymap, idle lifecycle, focus polish,
session pool with cross-restart reuse, RAM meter), Phase A Step 1–3
(EJECT, construct injection q/Q, limits modal `l`).

### Tier 1+ Observability — B1
Activity chatlog. Mechanical event extraction. Right-panel tab.
Color-coded, deque-backed, ExpandModal-magnifiable.

### Tier 2 — Profiles + Brake (C1, C2)
TOML loader, frozen Profile dataclass, ProfileRegistry (file-watch,
hot-reload), default profile auto-seeded, `default_construct_addendum`
+ `default_daemon_addendum`, daemon picks profile per-spawn via JSON,
`allowed_tools` narrowing, brake tiers (paranoid<default<yolo) with
two-axis privesc, P/D/Y sigils.

### Tier 2 — Tool registry partial (C3 partial)
Profiles + Scripts in registry; **Plugins NOT yet** (deferred).
C1g listification: nav rebind (lowercase=scroll, uppercase=walk),
Tools→ListView, Files→ListView, LaunchScreen modal. Phase A
deck-control protocol: dispatcher script, marker protocol parser,
construct system prompt addendum. Phase B Tools panel restructure:
Profiles + Scripts only; CONSTRUCT TOOLS dropped; literal `<home>`
removed; dir-reference labels removed; PERMISSIONS placeholder removed.

### Production-grade fixes (recent)
- Pane-log un-trim (raw event buffer + untruncated mode)
- Watchdog Q&A (`t`) with streaming default + wedge recovery
- Daemon chat (`T`) with stacked netrunner messages
- Goal-edit mid-flight (`e`) with diff classifier
- Connection state monitor with sidebar indicator
- Tabbed bottom panel (`[Daemon] [Watchdog]`)
- Spawn provenance origin badges
- z-to-view (file/profile/script) with syntax highlighting
- Path-normalized Files panel dedupe
- Focus navigation fall-through with empty-section escape
- Windows ProactorEventLoop shutdown noise filter

---

## Phase B — Observability (status)

- **B1 Activity chatlog**: ✓ shipped
- **B2 Fleet-level synthesizer**: deferred until D1 (local model)

---

## Phase C — Tier 2 status

- **C1 Profiles**: ✓ shipped
- **C2 Brake profiles**: ✓ shipped (rolled into C1's privesc gate)
- **C3 Tool registry tree**: 🟡 partial
  - ✓ Profiles registry
  - ✓ Scripts registry
  - ✗ Plugins (third leg)
  - ✗ Hierarchical Esc-up navigation
  - ✗ Script manifests

---

## Phase D — Local-model infrastructure (mostly hardware-blocked)

- **D1 Local model runtime** — pluggable client against Ollama-
  compatible API. Required for D2 and ideally for B2. Also unblocks
  the Watchdog substrate swap (cloud → local).
- **D2 Arbiter** — pre-daemon classifier with TOML policy.
  Hardware-blocked for production (RK3588 NPU latency); could
  prototype on dev with measured-not-guessed latency.
- **D3 Synthesizer (B2) on local substrate** — once D1 is in.

---

## Phase E — Compliance mode (deferred indefinitely)

See `cyberdeck-compliance-future.md`. Tokenization, secret store,
watchdog blindfold. Personal use doesn't need it.

---

## Other deferred work (no current phase home)

Roughly ordered by likely appeal:

1. **Plugin scaffolding (C3 third leg)** — the largest unscratched
   item. Hardware (camera, IR, NFC) and external (MCP servers). Now
   that the registry shape is real (profiles + scripts), plugins just
   need a protocol design and a first plugin to validate the shape.
2. **Real-deck shakedown on Windows.** Several of the latest features
   are mock-tested AND user-confirmed on real deck — no further
   shakedown urgent. But ongoing real-deck use will continue to
   surface bugs faster than mocks can.
3. **Connection consequences** — spawn-blocking on Degraded, daemon
   parking, recovery flow. Detection is shipped; consequences need
   hooks into spawn path + daemon lifecycle. Smallest M5+ slice.
4. **Watchdog tripwires + blacklist** — DSL, deterministic matcher,
   alert routing. Where `Shift+K` hard-kill-and-blacklist lands.
5. **Script manifests** — declarative `(name, category, args, expected
   output shape)` per spec. Currently raw filenames only.
6. **Construct script-launch wiring** — ScriptListItem space lands
   here once manifests exist.
7. **Goal-edit force-push** — apply-now interrupt of in-flight turn.
8. **Daemon pause/unpause (`E`).**
9. **Plugin airgap (`p`), quickfire (`c`), picker (`Shift+C`).**

---

## Non-goals / explicit "we don't want this"

- **Inter-agent chatter as load-bearing communication.** Chatlog is
  observational, not communicative. Wirings stay limited.
- **Real-time per-construct narration via small model.** Mechanical
  beats model-narrated for glance-interpretation. Synthesis is the
  right job; narration is not.
- **Per-profile pool warming.** Pool always warms with default.
- **Built-in Claude Code tools surfaced as registry citizens.**
  They're Claude Code's surface, not the deck's.
- **Spawn-blocking on Online.** Connection consequences only kick in
  on Degraded/Offline. Online stays unconstrained.
- **Merging daemon and watchdog.** Soft/loud distinction is core.

---

## Tech debt / known unknowns (not blocking)

- Script polling at refresh time (piggybacks on registry events)
- Watchdog substrate cloud-only until D1
- Connection consequences indicator-only until M5+
- Goal-diff classifier crude stem (-es plurals mis-class sometimes)
- `Fleet.spawn()` slice (`_build_command()[1:]`) — builder API ugly
- `Construct.kill()` state pre-confirmation
- `classify_event` bare strings
- Read tool 25k token limit — profiles bias toward Bash+wc-l
- Long-running watchdog session accumulates context indefinitely
- Real claude `--resume` partial-turn semantics — best-effort
- Multi-file-edit footgun in chat era — Claude Code era will be
  different (in-place edits)

---

## Migration: chat → Claude Code

**Pivot point:** at ~12k LOC, multi-file edits and grep-the-codebase
operations have outgrown chat. Claude Code edits in place, runs greps
natively, doesn't suffer chat context truncation.

**Documents to bring:**
- `cyberdeck-state.md` (cumulative state through migration)
- `cyberdeck-build-plan.md` (this file)
- `cyberdeck-claude-code-orientation.md` (workflow + rules)
- `cyberdeck-spec.md` (architectural canon)
- `cyberdeck-philosophy.md` (the why)

**First Claude Code session priorities (open questions):**
1. Plugin scaffolding (largest unscratched piece)
2. Connection consequences (smallest M5+ bite)
3. Tools-research chat (from `cyberdeck-tools-research-seed.md`)

*This file is the source of truth for milestone ordering. When in
doubt, this beats memory.*
